# Motivation 
Breast cancer is a serious and common health isuue wordlwide , and early diagnosis is critical to save lives .
Data mining techiniques can provide valuable support in improving diagnosis and assistance medical decision making .

we chose this dataset because :
-It is widely used in machine learning and medical research , making it reliable and well studied .
-It contains suffient rows (*569)and attributes (30*) for meaningful analysis .
-The target variable (benign/malignant) is clear and suitable for both *classification* and *clustering* tasks

# Objective
Assist in early detction of breast cancer by building models that classify cases accurately

Identify similar groups using clastring techniques to uncover additional insights for diagnosis 

Provide clear and interpretable model that could support healthcare professionals in making timely and informed decisions
