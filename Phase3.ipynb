        "This project aims to analyze a dataset containing features computed from digitized images of fine-needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. By applying classification and clustering techniques, we aim to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign, and to explore patterns and similarities among cases to gain deeper insights into the characteristics of cancerous and non-cancerous cells."
